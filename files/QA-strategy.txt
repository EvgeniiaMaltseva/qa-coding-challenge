QA strategy

1. What types of tests would you create to cover this app?
- API / Integration Tests
- End-to-End UI tests
- Exploratory and visual regression tests
- Performance and user experience testing

2. Describe briefly what test cases would you write, and which ones would you cover with
automated tests? Name a couple of edge cases you’ve noticed.
Test Cases to Automate:
Core Business Flow:
Since each employment status leads to a different form configuration, I would create separate E2E happy-path tests for each status to ensure users can:
    - Complete the form successfully
    - Receive a calculated offer
    - Proceed to the application form
    - Request an offer via email
    - Arrange a consultation appointment

Tariff Configuration:
- Validate that client can configure tariff options independently
- Verify all insurance types can be selected:
    - Vollversicherung
    - Zahnzusatzversicherung
    - Krankenhauszusatzversicherung (hospital supplementary insurance)
- Validate all offer types:
    - Premium
    - Business
    - First Class
- Validate custom configuration options such as:
    - Selbstbehalt
    - Zimmerwahl

Form Validation:
- Ensure required fields cannot be skipped, 
- Verify validation error messages for incorrect or incomplete inputs
- Ensure users cannot proceed to the next step without valid data

Navigation and State Handling:
- Verify users can navigate back and modify previously entered data
- Ensure form state updates correctly after changes
- Validate the reset functionality
- Verify the “Contact an Agent” functionality

Edge Cases:
- Insurance eligibility depends on income thresholds
- Boundary ages, future or invalid birth dates
- Children can only be insured up to the age of 20 and have their own tarif options
- Switching employment status mid-process
- Refreshing the page during the process

Not to automate:
- Exploratory testing
- Visual UI validation
